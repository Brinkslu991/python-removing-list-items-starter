## Practice: Removing List Elements

### Your GitHub Repo

- Create a new GitHub repo named: **removing-list-elements**
- Upload your script to this repo

### Your Tasks

- Complete these programming tasks
- Use a Python comment to label each task in your script, e.g. # Task 1, # Task 2, etc.

#### Task 1

- Define a Python list of your favorite performers, vacation destinations, or Superbowl snacks
- Add 6 - 7 elements to your list
- Print the original list

#### Task 2

- Use the `pop()` method without an index number to remove the last item from your list
- Print the updated list
- Then use the `pop()` method WITH an index number to remove a specific item from your list
- Print the updated list


#### Task 3

- Use the `remove()` method to remove an element of your choice from the list
- Print the updated list

#### Task 4

- Use the `del` keyword to remove another element of your choice from the list
- Print the updated list

#### Task 5

- Use the `clear()` method to clear the remaining elements from your list
- Print the cleared list (Python should just show you an empty list, which looks like `[ ]` on your screen)
